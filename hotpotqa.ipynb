There were many variants produced, often under license which ranged in length from 40 to 58 calibers, but 40 caliber was the most common version.. 6-pounders were widely used by the navies of a number of nations and often used by both sides in a conflict. Due to advances in torpedo delivery and performance, 6-pounder guns were rapidly made obsolete and were replaced with larger guns aboard most larger warships. This led to their being used ashore during World War I as coastal defense guns, the first tank guns and as anti-aircraft guns, whether on improvised or specialized HA/LA mounts.\n",

Koeman scored over 250 goals whilst playing in defence for the majority of his career. Koeman was capable of playing both as a defender and as a midfielder; he frequently played as a sweeper, although he was equally known for his goalscoring, long-range shooting, and accuracy from free kicks and penalties. Because of his goalscoring, he is considered one of the best attacking center backs of all time.[3].

Following the end of the 2013–14 campaign, Southampton released six players.[7] The club also made a number of sales, with striker Rickie Lambert,[8] captain Adam Lallana,[9] centre-back Dejan Lovren,[10] left-back Luke Shaw,[11] right-back Calum Chambers[12] and striker Billy Sharp all leaving.[13] Dani Osvaldo,[14] Jordan Turnbull,[15] Jos Hooiveld,[16] Gastón Ramírez,[17] Jake Sinclair,[18] Jack Stephens,[19] Artur Boruc[20] and Will Britt were loaned out.[21]. In the summer transfer window, the Saints made six full signings – winger Dušan Tadić from Twente,[22] striker Graziano Pellè from Feyenoord,[23] goalkeeper Fraser Forster from Celtic,[24] striker Shane Long from Hull City,[25] centre-back Florin Gardoș from Steaua București[26] and attacking midfielder Sadio Mané from Red Bull Salzburg.[27] The club also brought in Ryan Bertrand, Saphir Taïder and Toby Alderweireld on loans.[14][27][28] Taïder left just three weeks after joining.[29]. In January 2015 the club signed Bertrand on a full transfer, as well as bringing in midfielders Eljero Elia and Filip Đuričić on loan from Werder Bremen and Benfica, respectively.[30][31] Midfielder Jack Cork left to join Swansea City,[32] while loan deals were completed for Jos Hooiveld to Millwall, Dani Osvaldo to Boca Juniors and Lloyd Isgrove to Sheffield Wednesday.[33][34][35] The loans of both Artur Boruc and Jack Stephens were extended until the end of the season.[36][37].\n",
